## Brief info about Silver-RAT

Silver-RAT is a sophisticated Remote Access Trojan (RAT) first released in October 2022 by a threat actor group known as "Anonymous Arabic." and was developed in C#.

The RAT offers an extensive toolkit of malicious capabilities, including:

- **Anti-virus bypass** mechanisms
- **Browser data theft** functionality for stealing cookies and credentials
- **Keylogging** to capture user input
- **Hidden browser** and **hidden RDP access** for covert operations
- **Ransomware functionality** for data encryption
- **System restore point destruction** to prevent recovery
- **UAC bypass** for elevated privileges
- **Execution delay** options to evade detection

A leak occurred in October 2023 when cracked versions became freely available on Telegram and GitHub.

You can get the RAT source code [here](https://github.com/unheard44/fluid_bean/releases/tag/releases) (if it hasn't been taken down).
